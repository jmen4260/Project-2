<h1> My Personal Values </h1>
<div class="column">
  <h2>Three qualities of someone I admire</h2>
  <p>Someone I admire is a priest at my church. He's a great listener and a great leader. I admire that he can always come across as a non-judgemental person. </p>
</div>
<div class="column">
  <h3>An incident that has taught me a lesson "the hard way"</h3>
  <p> Is when I had chosen to sneak out of the house rather than asking for permission. It lead me to a great scolding. I learned that these situations lead to panicking parents and endagering yourslef.
</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h4>Changes I would make to myself to fit my ideal "better person"</h4>
<p>My ideal better person is someone who is filled with effort, is a great student, and is more independent. My lack of effort leads me down a rabbit hole of making up assignments last minute amongst other things. Along with this I wish to become a more independent person in many aspects in my life.</p>

<h5>Three qualities I value in a friend/teacher/ and parent:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Honesty</li>
  <li>Kindness</li>
  <li>Communication Skills</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h6>The most important person in my life who helped establish my values</h6>
  <p>Would be my mother, she has always been there for me and the person I have been the closest too. So without a doubt most of my values would come from her.</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h7>One rule that I believe is important to live my life by</h7>
<p>It would be to live a simple and honest life.</p>
</div>
<div class="column">
<h8>If we lived in a perfect world, how would people behave differently than they do now?</h8>
<p>People would'nt solve issues through violence. Instead they'd have better communicative skills.</p>
